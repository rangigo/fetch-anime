# FetchAnime

## Live Demo: https://rangigo.github.io/fetch-anime

## Inspiration
I build this project as I have a strong passion for animes, and in addition the internet lacks the website to curate infos about the latest episodes of seasonal animes. Thus the idea for this web was born!



## Features
* Get the latest animes infos
* Pagination & skeleton loader to improve user experience
* Navigate animes by season/year/genres/formats
* Countdown to the next airing episode of this season animes!

## Coming soon
* Sorting options 
* Filter seasonal anime list 
* Search animes by title (from the AniList database)
* User database to add favorite animes on watch list!

## Technologies used
* React
* SASS/CSS Module 
* AniList GraphQL API

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

**You’ll need to have Node >= 6 on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.
